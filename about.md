## FAQ

All the things you want to know about me. Allow me to ask and answer the questions!

#### Who are you?

Currently I'm a developer advocate!  

Some kind of enterprise-y web developer/designer/UXer fighting for the end users. I love helping other developers develop their skills and I want everyone's lives to be more efficient through the help of technology. I know enough about security and architecture to ask the hard questions. I'm currently dabbling in AI (Machine Learning, Deep Learning) because it reminds me of my undergraduate research in distributed multi agent systems. Oh and because its awesome.

I'm a consumer of the internet and cautiously exploring the internet of things. I love open source.

Oh and I'm a millennial.

Which is why "Millennial Tech Female" came to be. Basically I stuck a bunch of descriptive buzzwords together as a sarcastic jab at myself. While I think those words literally describe me, I don't think all the things written on the internet about "millennials" or "tech females" actually describe who I am. But I'll let you be the judge of that. 

#### Current employer?

IBM

#### Alma Mater?

Trinity University in San Antonio, TX

#### Favorite programming language?

Currently JavaScript. Favorite library? AngularJS with Bootstrap. I like big JS libraries and I cannot lie.

#### Language on deck to learn?

Python. 

Does React count too?

#### Volunteer anywhere?

I'm a member of the Trinity University Computer Science Advisor Board. 

I've previously been a part of Girls on the Run PDX. 

Previously - [Women Who Code Portland Community Lead](https://medium.com/@WWCodePortland/meet-the-team-amara-keller-community-lead-8f8dbf244051#.awn01uv6g)

#### Any side projects? Non-coding hobbies?

I've neglected this, but it's still online ->>> Yes! I run the blog [kitchenDebug](http://kitchenDebug.com) and a corresponding YT [channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/Kitchendebug ). If you are looking to get into the kitchen (or back into the kitchen) I hope I can give you the inspirational bump you need! I'm dabbling in homebrewing as well.

#### Resume?

Ask me. I'll eventually get some sort of narrative version up and running for your viewing pleasure as well.
