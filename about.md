## FAQ

All the things you want to know about me. Allow me to ask and answer the questions!

#### Who are you?

Some kind of enterprise-y web developer/designer/UXer fighting for the end users. I know enough about security and architecture to ask the hard questions. I'm a consumer of the internet and cautiously exploring the internet of things.

Oh and I'm a millennial. 

#### Current employer?

Intel

#### Alma Mater?

Trinity University in San Antonio, TX

#### Favorite programming language?

Currently JavaScript. Favorite library? AngularJS with Bootstrap. I like big JS libraries and I cannot lie.

#### Any side projects? Non-coding hobbies?

Yes! I run the blog [kitchenDebug](http://kitchenDebug.com) and a corresponding YT [channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/Kitchendebug ). If you are looking to get into the kitchen (or back into the kitchen) I hope I can give you the inspirational bump you need! I'm dabbling in homebrewing as well.

#### Resume?

Ask me. I'll eventually get some sort of narrative version up and running for your viewing pleasure as well.
