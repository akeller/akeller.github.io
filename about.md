## FAQ

All the things you want to know about me. Allow me to ask and answer the questions!

#### Current employer?

Intel

#### Favorite programming language?

Currently JavaScript. Favorite library? AngularJS with Bootstrap. I like big JS libraries and I cannot lie.

#### Any side projects? Non-coding hobbies?

Yes! I run the blog [kitchenDebug](kitchendebug.com) and a corresponding YT [channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/Kitchendebug ). If you are looking to get into the kitchen (or back into the kitchen) I hope I can give you the inspirational bump you need! I'm dabbling in homebrewing as well.

#### Resume?

Ask me via Twitter or Email. I'll eventually get some sort of narrative version up and running for your viewing pleasure as well.
