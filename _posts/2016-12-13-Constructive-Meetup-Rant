title: My (Constructive) Meetup Rant for 2016
---

I put together some ~~pointers~~ ~~tips~~ improvements(?) after my full year (YAAY!) of attending, assisting, and speaking at meetups. By no means is this a comprehensive post. These are the things that irk me and may be less obvious, with some tips on how to fix each. If I didn't have at least a small suggestion of how to fix it, I didn't mention it - I wanted to keep this as constructive as possible. If you run a meetup and you feel like you are doing all the right things but looking to be more inclusive, these may be good places to start.

### Your hands-on meetups require technology I may not have access to.
The moment you write something like "NO PC", you've excluded potential members of your audience. Changing your language can make this more inclusive. "Bring your Mac or follow along with a new friend!" That way the Windows and Linux community may show up, rather than stay home. It's not my fault my company provided machine is a Windows or a Mac. Sometimes you just get what you get, and if that's the only portable system I have access to I don't want to feel stuck. And who knows, maybe that attendee becomes inspired to port it! 

### You gave vague directions to the meetup. 
Go ahead and assume your attendees have never been to the location, let alone inside. Personally, I'm already uncomfortable going to a place I've never been, and the more validation I have on my walk to the meetup room the better I feel. Post signs everywhere, feel ridiculous for being so obvious. The more comfortable people are, the more successful the event (or events) will be. Make it so easy to find, the most overwhelming thing I have to do is figure out what kind of free pizza I'm eating tonight. 

### You forgot to unlock the door. 
I can feel the eyes rolling on this one. "Duh" you say. This happened to a meetup I helped host (oops). Then it happened to a meetup I attended. Different locations! Make sure the door doesn't automatically lock at 5 (or 6) and if the lobby needs an attendant, pay for one or staff it yourself. Also have a backup plan. "Can't get in? Tweet/DM/Slack at us/me". And then monitor it!!! 

### You leave time for networking, but offer no ice breaker. 
You know that awkward silence before a meetup starts? Its weird and uncomfortable. I like to sit in meetups and observe at first. If I attend a meetup that's mostly male (which, lets be honest, is all of them unless I attend a women specific meetup group), I can almost guarantee I will have to initiate any and all conversation I want to have that night. If you own the meetup (or are a speaker!), make it your mission to talk to everyone. "What brings you here? What are you looking to get out of this?" Not only does it make everyone feel more comfortable, you've started a potential feedback loop. 

### You only allow "expert" speakers.
Unless your audience is 100% experts themselves, there should be opportunities to grow the speaking skills of your non-expert community members by allowing them to speak too. Teaching someone to swim after years of knowing how to swim doesn't work for everyone. Did that analogy not work for you? How about learning how to drive from an automotive engineer. Sounds like overkill. Depending on the topic, the community may benefit from hearing how someone learned, which may have been a really long time ago for an expert. Tech is constantly changing and to keep up we are constantly learning, so learning how someone learned can be incredibly beneficial.  

### "Save questions to the end" but don't enforce it.
Please keep to the schedule as close as you can. Not everyone can stay the entire duration of the meetup. Not every speaker can cope with being interrupted. Either you allow questions during or you have dedicated Q&A at the end. I have the attention span of a goldfish, particularly as the day turns to night so these "forced interrupts" while I'm processing are painful when unexpected (for listening or speaking!). 

### Your online communities are hard to join.
Is your Google Group dead? Decomission it or put up a banner. Is your admin doing everything manually that could be programmatic? Be transparent about it. Or make it easier (read automatic). I might have met some cool people I'd like to stay in touch with!

### You don't have a CoC, offline or on. 
A code of conduct (CoC) may seem ridiculously obvious, but sometimes community members need a reminder and an admin/moderator may need a little help. Being able to point to a something stating what behavior is acceptable and what behavior is not acceptable can make a huge difference in making someone feel more comfortable particpating. I know individuals that will not attend or speak at events without one. 

I said "comfortable" a ton in this post. You could easily swap in "safe". Meetups bring a group of people together with some sort of similar interest, but that also means they could have other very different interests too. "Like likes like" comes to mind, and not in the negative sense it usually comes up in with tech hiring. I started going to meetups specifically for women in tech because I wanted at least two similarities or commonalities - women and tech. It made me feel more included, safer, and comfortable to go sit with a group of strangers for 2-3 hours. And a funny thing happens you go again, you start seeing the same "strangers" and they start turning into part of your network, and suddenly they are your friends! 

Do you feel like you are fostering a "safe" or "comfortable" space at the meetups you run, speak at, or attend? What irks you about the meetups you've been a part of? Tweet at me, let me know! (Maybe one day I'll get a commenting system, if that's of interest).
