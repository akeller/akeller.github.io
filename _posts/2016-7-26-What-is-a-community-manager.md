# Hellooo Out There!
 
You may have seen me answering or tagging your questions. Or maybe you have not!
 
My name is Amara Keller and I am the TAP Community Manager. Just like you I'm learning how TAP works, who uses TAP, and what features and functionality would be great to have in the future. I have a background in enterprise application development in IT, focused on line of business applications for a variety of business groups, but I wanted to step into developer relations. I love talking to other developers and technical teams about how to use software. And most importantly I love talking to other developer and technical teams about how to use the software most efficiently and effectively. The less head scratching (or head banging) moments you have fighting the tools that were supposed to make your actual jobs easier the better.
 
## "So what is a community manager?"
 
I manage the community, which is exactly what it sounds like. I read your posts, answer them myself if I can, and if I cannot that's when I start engaging with my teammates. I work internally to get all the cool things we are doing presented out in an external manner, through blogs, webinars, and meetups. I'm part cheerleader and part nag, but in a good way! I enable the external users and the internal engineers to work together so everyone succeeds. Our product gets better, we get more users. Everyone wins!
 
I am still learning TAP and the surrounding technologies so I cannot answer all your questions, but I can find the people or documentation that may help. Eventually my goal is to answer most of the technical questions directly. But for now I am mostly behind the scenes sending emails and walking around the office looking for subject matter experts to answer your questions.
"What's actually going on with the community?"
 
Our community is actively growing and I am trying to figure out the best way to enable you to ask questions and get more information fast. Things may move around from time to time, but nothing should ever be deleted. I read everything as it comes in. Including the question you asked and deleted last night while I was sleeping. Yes, I see that too.
 
You may notice a "being answered" tag pop up on your question. That's me tracking to make sure we get you a response. You can help me by marking an answer with "Helpful" and "Correct Answer" as you feel appropriate. Once you mark a "Correct Answer", you will see me remove the "being answered" tag from your question. If you have a follow on question, please create another discussion thread and feel free to add a link to the previously answered one. If a question is marked as having a "Correct Answer" we consider it part of our knowledge base and may not monitor the thread as closely.
 
You may also notice I added a Code of Conduct. This is important to have in a community. Please review it and abide by it. Failure to do so will result in removal from the community site.
 
## "What can I do to help?"
 
I love hearing your feedback so let me know when something is working or not working. Are you doing cool things with TAP you would like to showcase? Let me know that too!  Are you interested in our overall vision for the community? I can talk about that too. Feel free to comment below.
