# What makes a good IDE?

I love IDEs. Particularly small open source ones. I want them to be lightweight, fast, and just work. I am pretty sure I have downloaded and dabbled in all of them. Or what feels like all of them.

I have struggled on and off with Eclipse mostly because I have been working on and off with Eclipse. I would say we have a love-hate relationship and I am sure Eclipse would agree. I have adjusted my heap size, closed any other application  I am running, and gone into each interaction with as much patience as I can muster be we've always had issues.

That said, I have also moved away from Java and Scala development into mostly JavaScript front-end work. With that comes tremendous flexiblity in IDEs. So I'm going to start a blog series recapping my likes, dislikes, trials and tribulations of each IDE I put my hands on. 

Here is the list:
* Eclipse
* Visual Studio
* Vim
* Sublime Text
* Cloud9
* Brackets
* Notepad++
* Atom
* Visual Studio Code

I wont go in order, I am certain of that.

Before I start this series, I will say this: my biggest hang up on actually using an IDE regularly is proxy support. I sit behind a corporate firewall - I have to have proxy support. Not having proxy support (even with hacks!) prohibits me from using your product in my daily job. If I only get to use your product during nights and weekends, it just wont cut it for me.

# TL;DR (Too long, didn't read)

In my humble opinion, proxy support makes a good IDE.
