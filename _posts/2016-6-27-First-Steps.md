title: My First Steps Into Big Data, Analytics, and TAP!

You may have seen my previous blog on the TAP Support. If you have, hi again! If you have not, check it out: Thoughts on Spark Summit West 2016.
 
My name is Amara Keller and I'm the TAP Community Manager. Previously I was an enterprise application developer working on line of business applications in spaces like finance, supply chain, and sales and marketing. With my new position came the somewhat daunting task of learning about the technologies in and around TAP, including Big Data and Analytics. As I ramp I am pulling together a list of resources I have used, so I decided to make it public for others to benefit. Below is my experience in narrative form, but stay tuned for bite-sized documents on TAP Support
 
I had two "kick starter" moments that I understand most people would not necessarily have the chance to do organically. First, I was able to attend the all day TAP tutorial session at OSCON. With no other experience, I was able to sit through a hands-on workshop that walked through data ingestion, processing, model creation, and finally integrating with an application later. This presented me with the unique opportunity to hear Chuck Freedman, Kyle Ambert, and Venkatesh Bharadwaj talk about TAP. Currently I am walking through the same tutorial and building out instructions on the community site with the updated version of TAP. We hope this will help make the instructions more accessible and easier to update. It is currently a work in progress: Workshop: Data to Dashboard.
 
My second "kick starter" moment was at Spark Summit. I was able to attend the keynotes and lecture style sessions to learn more about the entire Spark ecosystem. This helped me understand how open source is influencing the growth of Big Data and analytics. This was where I heard about "streaming" and the idea that Spark based applications could have data continuously instead of static or batch. Streaming data makes an application extremely powerful. With real time data, new trends can be identified immediately and models can be trained faster. This yields better recommendations when you browse Netflix, more personalization when you drive your Tesla, and even more satisfying results when you receive your latest Stitchfix box. Customers an end users get a better experience when Big Data is processed faster.
 
In addition to streaming, there were tons of talks on tools that make developers and data scientists more efficient. This is where I really felt TAP was making the most impact. TAP assists the technical team in processing data, generating a model, and building an application with a tested, "trusted" stack. At the time I was not entirely sure what "trusted" meant, but slowly I am getting a better understanding.
 
At Spark Summit I also started following influential people on Twitter in the Big Data and analytics space by reading through the respective hashtags: #bigdata and #analytics. Through Spark Summit I also followed some companies and their engineering teams that had a presence at the conference. (Which reminds me, I need to pull together some Twitter lists!)
 
Once I got back from Spark Summit, I started Googling everything. Any product, library, company, or platform I heard about I had pulled up in a browser. I signed up to play around in Databricks Community Edition. I was all over GitHub. I checked out Spark Streaming. I wanted to see all the pieces and how they fit together.
 
From there I went to Stack Overflow, YouTube, and Pluralsight. These are my go to sites for learning more in depth about new topics. Stack Overflow is a great place to see what developers are doing with technology and where they are getting stuck. I found a YouTube playlist by ODSC where I could listen to recorded meetup sessions. I watched a Pluralsight (license fee required) class on Understanding Machine Learning with R and queue up others on Python, HDFS, Docker, Hadoop, and Spark. I realized my Pluralsight list was so extensive, I will put them in a separate place that I will update as more classes are added (and I have time to take them!).
 
How did you step into Big Data, analytics, and TAP? What are your favorite resources for learning more about Big Data and Analytics? What tools or resources do you still use? What additional resources would you like to see for TAP? I would love to hear your experience and how you learn in the comments below!
