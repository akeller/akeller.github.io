title: Brackets - A Review
---

[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is a lightweight open source text editor for front end developers and designers. It's a little be more than WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) while because exactly what you think it is - an editor for designers and web developers. If you need support for Python, Java, C++, etc. you can probably go ahead and skip over Brackets. The goodness for Brackets is deeply rooted in web dev.

## Where I Come In

All of that said, Brackets didn't just appear. In fact its been around since late 2014 and I downloaded it shortly after it came out of Beta in 2015. I took the opportunity to play around with different text editors and IDEs as I was learning a new library, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). So why not make the learning curve steeper! 

One of the huge reasons for immediately wanting to switch over to Brackets is the Live Preview feature. When I'm in the early early stages of developing a new front end I'm making changes, building and destroying faster than I can keep up with, let alone my CTRL + S or build can handle. Have something that live updates is pretty nice! 

## Where I Leave

Unless it doesn't work.... and it did not work with AngularJS. I left Brackets and went back to my previous editor - [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

## Where I Come Back

I recently decided to give Brackets a retry since I was now moving on to some explore work in [Angular2](https://angular.io/)! Because again, why not make the learning curve steeper! This time I decided that whether Live Preview worked for me or not (it did!) I would dig a little deeper. 

### The Lists

Pros
* Extensions
* Themes
* Live Preview
* Lightweight
* Split screen
* Inline editting
* JSON format style settings
* Proxy support
* Web dev & design oriented

Cons
* 30,000 file limit
* Proxy support...
* Web dev & design oriented

To be fair, you can make an argument either way for most of these items. Except the 30,000 file limit... 

### The Elaboration

Brackets is nice enough to pop a modal explaining that features and files may or may not work or **show up** because file indexing has a limit of 30,000 files. Sure, you can start excluding big directories like node_modules (*npm install everything --please*) but I work on non-trivial apps. Sometimes I need to bring in (inherit) tons of stuff. 

Of course I could also take this time to clean up some of the potential junk that isn't being used or isn't needed (umm shims for IE8?). This would bring the 30,000 file limit into the "pros" list.

Remember my previous entry? I need proxy support because I sit behind an enterprise firewall. It's not you, its me. Or them. However you want to look at it.

Brackets has proxy support! Which is great and makes it totally usable for me. Where it fails is on upgrade. Every upgrade so far has required me to reconfigure proxy support. Luckily it's just one line, so its not the end of the world or anything. But it's frustrating when I want to hurry up and download a couple new extensions and just get stuck. So that's how proxy ended up on the pros **and** the cons list.

I'm not going to touch on everything in both lists, but I did want to end on a enormous pro: extensions. There are tons and tons of extensions. A few I like to use include Brackets File Tabs, Brackets Git, Brackets Icons, File Tree Exclude (for excluding that enormous node_modules directory), and Markdown Preview. If I find my favorite TypeScript and Angular ones I'll let you know.

## The End/Verdict

I'm still using it, so that says something! I can easily say there will be future posts.
