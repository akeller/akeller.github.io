title: Surviving VR
---

I don't think I've ever suffered motion sickness in my life. In fact, I took a friend on a rollercoaster at Six Flags Astroworld (RIP) so many times in a row she threw up uncontrollably on her hands and knees immediately after getting off the ride for like the 12th time. We were in middle school and trying to figure out what our physical limits were. She was fine, don't worry.

What I have suffered from, which I think is somewhat related, is what I can only describe as photosensitive headaches. I typically don't get them in an IMAX setting, but I almost always get them when I wear corrective lenses (glasses or contacts) to a live action 3D movie. And I need corrective lenses to see anything so I've solved that problem by just not going to 3D movies. These headaches can range from just annoying to full blown migraine. When I first bought a MacBook Pro back in 2007 I noticed the bright screen triggered headaches as well, which I've again solved by dimming the brightness on just about every screen I encounter and coding in an IDE with a black background when possible. I've also been known to wear sunglasses while on the computer and I've contemplated getting [Gunnars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HGAWJME/ref=twister_B00R4PKBH6?_encoding=UTF8&th=1).

All of this to say, I've been avoiding VR because I didn't really want to trigger a headache or, God forbid, a migraine. Or even worse, throw up. I've put a headset on for a couple minutes, looked around, and then taken it off. Honestly I was hoping it would go the route of home 3D tvs and just die. 

I'm a huge YouTube junkie, and I love watching people play video games. I don't have the time or the patience to engross myself in as many video games as I would like, plus staring at a screen without blinking to play a video game after staring at a screen all day for a paycheck makes my eyeballs hurt. But I've really enjoyed some of the VR games I've seen people play and I was definitely willing to give it a serious try. 

Fast forward to this past weekend when my boyfriend brought home an Oculus Rift!

Naturally this is the weekend I'm battling an on and off again set of migraine/headache combos. They end up being a combination of light and sound sensitive so even watching tv at times is hard. Finally Sunday night rolled around and I didn't have any sort of pressure in my head. It was time to play!

For starters, the headset is definitely not light but the weight across your head is pretty well distributed which I definitely appreciated. This is similar to the complaint I have with most smart watches - my small frame cannot support large/heavy/bulky items. So I felt my head pulling forward and down to a "resting" position. For extended play this might be an ergo issue.

I loved how the headset and straps were totally adjustable. I played with my contacts in so I had to adjust the headset lenses and suddenly the world was crisp. I'm definitely looking forward to either having a personal headset or some way to "save" settings like those fancy high end cars that can save your seat settings for Driver 1 and Driver 2. 

Apparently my head sweats like my hands when I hold a controller, so that was gross but normal. 

I played Job Simulator and Super Hot for about an hour, to both me and my boyfriend's surprise. Going back to what I mentioned about my video game habits, its a combination of little or no patience and not being able to sit still long enough to get anywhere in a game. I think I played GTA V for like 1 hour increments over the course of weeks and that's not a strategy that gets you anywhere but confused. But the VR experience kept me moving and engaged and apparently at one point during Super Hot I almost punched my boyfriend's computer monitor. 

One game (or game type) I would absolutely avoid is the ISS Simulator. This game has you experiencing the zero gravity delights of the International Space Station and there are no words to describe how awkward and uncomfortable it feels to know you are standing but see you are floating and rolling around. Hard pass. Another game I've heard makes even the strongest stomaches nauseous - Minecraft.

I had a great time playing VR and I'm definitely looking forward to playing again in the future. We are fortunate enough to already have two towers with beefy GPUs that can support VR. As much as I want to recommend it, I think the price point has to come down a bit to make it consumer friendly. Not only are the headset and touch controllers expensive, but your required system specs are going to cost you. So go make friends with someone who splurges on tech and offer to watch their pets/place when they go on vacation!

## My Tips For The Best VR Experience

* Don't play with a headache, it will probably just make it worse.
* Setup in a large, almost empty room, or a decent sized room with space and textured floors. Our hardwood floor, plastic mat covered study is great because you can "feel" when you are in the middle of the room.
* Take the time to fully adjust the headset. It can absolutely make or break the experience.
* Play games with a "fixed" position. Job Simulator's UI keeps you behind a desk or counter so standing up in one spot feels natural. 
* Plan on only playing for a small amount of time at first.
