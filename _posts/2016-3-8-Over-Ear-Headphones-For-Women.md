title: Over Ear Headphones For Women
---

I stabbed myself in the head today. Twice actually. Almost at the same time too. I can hear you saying "wow this blog is off to a really morbid thought", but stick with me here. 

I positioned my fantastic Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones (a gift from my audio tech savve boyfriend, who is really the best) over my ears and smashed two Kendra Scott White Pearl studs into the sides of my head with a pierce that made me think "OH GOD IM BLEEDING". 

So I check with a careful simultaneous swipe of my index fingers, because this in fact isn't my first rodeo as I've worn these headphones on and off daily for just over a year now. 

**Almost every day for a year** I've put my headphones on, jammed my earrings into my head, adjusted (slightly) and continued working with music or a podcast for my ears. 

I ask this on International Women's Day 2016, did Audio-Technica never do user acceptance testing or focus groups with anyone (man or woman) wearing earring(s)? Or is there some implicit understanding that *thou shall not wear earrings and over the ear headphones*? 

Sure, it's easy to blame Audio-Technica. But its anyone who makes over the ear headphones. A quick Google search for "over ear headphones earrings" yields a couple articles barely mentioning earring conflicts so much as something more like *people may mistake these earbuds for earrings they are so gorgeous*. A few mention pinched glasses. 

Oh?

Did someone inform the corrective lense wearing community that their frame wearing user experience may be impacted by over the ear headphones? Or do I just wait for my bent frames to do the talking?

So maybe instead of making pink and purple razors, toothbrushes, and office supplies we should focus on the greater earring wearing community which I assume is comprised of a handful of women and a smattering of men and get a set of over the ear headphones that doesn't result in facial piercing (and not the kind mom or dad wouldn't be too keen on). 

Do I wrap this up by mentioning I don't think the little dent in my hair after all day headphone use is cute? Not to mention it screams how anti social I was today.
