It should come as absolutely no surprise that I love ordering things from [Zappos](www.zappos.com). I feel like I'd be hardpressed to find someone that does not enjoy the experience. They are a quirky company that makes it painless for me to order goods and get them to my door, typically in under two days. More often than not they show up at the door prior to the tracking labels being updated. I could go on and on about how great Zappos is, but that's not exactly what this post is about.

Zappos has always been a company that looked like a cool place to be a part of. They've always had a rock solid UI/UX, their support is nice and even complimentary (thanks for reminding me I do have great taste!), and they seem to always be hiring and expanding. Which means I occasionally shop their careers too. To be fair, I shop just about everyone's career pages for every site I visit. What? I'm curious!

Something caught my eye today on this post: <http://jobs.jobvite.com/zappos/job/ocog2fwC>

Let's talk through why I love this, because this screams transparency and that's my thing right now. This job requistion could have also said "please tell us why we should believe you aren't a robot". This company is not looking for a front-end brain to just sit there and crank out code. This company is looking for someone who is going to walk in everyday with the unique and fun perspective they've worked so hard to build into their brand. 

Now all you job seekers, take note. You may have thought the more important section was the top section about what qualifications are necessary. Those are cool, I guess. But they look like pretty much every other modern web developer posting. If you are looking for a position with your favorite up and coming JavaScript library or framework go ahead and quit that because you know next year it will be "so last year". They didn't ask you to provide a cover letter with your favorite JavaScript library and why all of the others are garbage, they asked you for something that's pretty... well basic. Something that probably hasn't been debated up and down the internet. And you know what? My favorite tag is the `<applet>` tag because that's the first one I learned that did something cool. It showed my sweet Java (not JavaScript) fish game I made in my high school programming class. That not only shows I can think outside of the HTML5 box, as its not even supported in HTML5, but that totally dates me for better or worse. And its proves I can't escape the glow of a computer because I'm still here.

A more important comment I wanted to make to the job seekers was this - if you want a front-end development job, you are going to need a portfolio. You'll probably also need a GitHub account, a blog, a few decently received answers on Stack Overflow... this list goes on. If you've graduated and had at least one job, you'll need to show you can do something. If your employee agreement prohibits you from doing that, figure out a way to make a compromise. Maybe host an HTML version of your resume/CV and turn it into a SPA with good ol' Joe-shmo's JavaScript framework. Or write the whole thing in straight up plain old vanilla JavaScript. Then you can be like "I made each section into a component!" or even "This runs fast AND looks good!". Look at you, doing something.

Remember its all about marketing - marketing yourself as a person or marketing your company. As a company, I want my reqs to bring people in and make them want to be a part of that something I've worked so hard to create. As an applicant, I want to see a req that inspires me to apply, not just because I like a paycheck. Both sides need to be transparent and marketable. If one or neither isn't, then its an obvious mismatch.
